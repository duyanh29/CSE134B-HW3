                        <p>Worked in a same of six to develop a social mobile application which users can find classmates, and filter the list with options to find students in categories that  users want </p>
                        <p>Applied Agile Software process and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to build the app's behavior based on the users' needs</p>
                        <p>Conducted test cases for UI using Espresso and verified function using JUnit</p>

                        <p>Applied inheritance to define the relationship among different type of cells</p>
                        <p>Applied the concepts of interfaces and polymorphism to determine where each object should move to in the next move based on the type its cell</p>
